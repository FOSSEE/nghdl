# UPDATES - 

1. ATiny25/45/85 made by Shubahngi,Yaminee and Sumanto (eSim Summer Interns 2020) is added in their respective folders alongwith the examples done by them.

2. All C models of attiny contain timer1 + timer0(all 4 four modes).

3. Added "Stats" folder which contains completion status and performance characteristics.

4. "Source_Codes" folder contains last stable models and "Latest" contains the models on which work is ongoing, so maybe unstable/inaccurate for general use. **(as per latest edit, C models in both folders are same)**

**Note - AT25/45/85 (both models and examples) are not tested at this point and therefore not garunteed to work**



# Work that will be done next - 

1. Documentation to be updated to incorporate changes made in C models
