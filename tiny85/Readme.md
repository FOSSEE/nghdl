Steps to be followed for simulating uC - 

1. Generate NGHDL mode lof attiny85 by the "attiny85_nghdl.vhdl" file provided.

2. Copy the hex file, ghdl_access.vhdl, tiny_85_c.c and start_server.sh files to DUTghdl folder of the model generated by NGHDL.

3. Run in normally eSim.

Things updated - 
1. Now pc implemented in C file.
2. RJMP done and fully tested.
3. VHDL, ghdl_access and C files.

Things to be updated - 
1. Documentation (Since PC implemented in C insted aof VHDL.
2. RJMP needs to be debugged. (giving wrong value at C000)
