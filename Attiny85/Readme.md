Steps to be followed for simulating uC - 

1. Generate NGHDL mode lof attiny85 by the "attiny85_nghdl.vhdl" file provided.

2. Copy the hex file, "ghdl_access.vhdl", "tiny_85_c.c" and "start_server.sh" files to DUTghdl folder of the model generated by NGHDL.

NOTE - the name of hex file should be "hex.txt" only

3. Run in normally eSim.

Things updated - 
1. Now pc implemented in C file.
2. RJMP done and fully tested.
3. VHDL, ghdl_access and C files.

Things to be updated - 
1. Documentation (Since PC implemented in C insted of VHDL).
